### StateIQtest.Org is Property of STATEIQTEST LIMITED, A Limited Company Located In Ireland.

Our mission started during the first Covid-19 outbreak, where we sought to improve upon the accuracy, quality and security of many other online IQ tests. We felt that many other online IQ tests left a lot to be desired in terms of their assuredness or security. We also felt that while many gave a somewhat valid score, they were severely lacking on what they gave you as a result. Though you may be fairly sure of a tests legitimacy, their results are usually either confusing or not enough to pay money for. On average, our test takes about 20-30 minutes to complete. Upon completion of the test, you will have the option to pay for a complete breakdown of your results, a sample of which is provided. If you choose not to pay, you will instead receive an IQ score range within 15 points of your score. We want your experience at stateIQtest.org to be simple yet challenging and fun!


EX. If you score as having an IQ of 133, your score will be reflected as having an IQ between 130-145.


In the optional breakdown, you will receive an exact score rather than a score range. You will also receive what you scored in each category. Currently our scoring categories are linguistic reasoning, spatial reasoning and logical ability. This evaluation is currently priced at $2.99 and helps us to keep our site running. A sample of one part of our score breakdown service is pictured below. As we conduct more research and expand our test further, scores are subject to change. We are always seeking to expand our methods of test development and analysis as well as our understanding of the human consciousness through a methodical and scientific lens. Unlike other online IQ tests, our online IQ test seeks to grow with accuracy overtime, which is why we hope you will join us in our eventual goal which is to be able to provide cognitive and psychological evaluation seamlessly with the use of the internet. This IQ test is only a small sample of what we have in store, as we intend to continue research and development into what we love to do best.


Our dream is to ensure that effective, discreet and secure at home psychometric testing becomes a reality for everyone. One step at a time, we seek to change the way people and societies view IQ, intelligence, themselves and the relationship between their measurable intelligence and their personality. As we continue to develop our test and its core functionality alongside you, we will be able to tell you more about our other exciting projects and developments! If you would like to contact us for any reason, feel free to reach us at stateiqtest.org@gmail.com

We look forward to having you take the test!
