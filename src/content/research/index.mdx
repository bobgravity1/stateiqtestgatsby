### IQ test research, IQ test development and IQ test scoring metrics, different kinds of IQ tests and their functions.

Our goal is to help people elevate and improve their understanding of themselves. Our method of test development is unique and involves the collection of a large sample size of results; including from various independent sources. The larger this sample size becomes, the more accurate and reflective of intelligence the IQ test and the IQ results given will become. While most other services struggle in their ability to update their method of testing as well as to offer a satisfactory product, we accomplish both by offering a state of the art IQ test that puts you at the heart of what we do. We not only seek to offer the best online IQ test, we seek to give users a unique result that reflects who they are as a person, so that they may be better able to understand their intellectual strengths and weaknesses in the future. In all, our service provides a high quality result for a fair price.

Our immediate goals are to expand our research and development to gain a better understanding of human behaviour. In order to do this, we have developed a unique scoring and testing method that improves itself overtime to be more accurate. We believe that by shifting our ways of thinking overtime and training ourselves to become constantly adaptive, improvement on fluid IQ is possible. Fluid IQ being the rough measurement of tasks you have the capability of doing or learning; Crystallized IQ or crystalized knowledge is a collection of things you already know how to do or information that you have already retained.
