### About our research, IQ test development, Scoring metrics and different kinds of tests and their functions.

Our goal is to help people elevate and improve their understanding of themselves. Our method of test development is unique and involves the collection of a large sample size of results; including from various independent sources. The larger this sample size becomes, the more accurate and reflective of intelligence the IQ test and the IQ results given will become. While most other services struggle in their ability to update their method of testing as well as to offer a satisfactory product, we accomplish both by offering a state of the art IQ test that puts you at the heart of what we do. We not only seek to offer the best online IQ test, we seek to give users a unique result that reflects who they are as a person, so that they may be better able to understand their intellectual strengths and weaknesses in the future. In all, our service provides a high quality result for a fair price.

Our immediate goals are to expand our research and development to gain a better understanding of human behaviour. In order to do this, we have developed a unique scoring and testing method that improves itself overtime to be more accurate. We believe that by shifting our ways of thinking overtime and training ourselves to become constantly adaptive, improvement on fluid IQ is possible. Fluid IQ being the rough measurement of tasks you have the capability of doing or learning; Crystallized IQ or crystalized knowledge is a collection of things you already know how to do or information that you have already retained.

Long term research suggests that those who suffer from brain injuries may retain their crystallized knowledge, but their fluid IQ could plummet. In recent years there have been various reports of people having had traumatic brain injuries being able to increase their intelligence so long as their brain is still in development. It was believed for a long time that improvements on born intelligence were not possible, that they were fixed, if not from birth then from a certain age of foundational brain development. However, newer reports have suggested that improvements on intelligence and conduct is possible at any age, of people in any occupation or without one, and at any level of educational achievement.


IQ tests, though accurate as they may be as a prediction of aptitude in a certain area, cannot be used to quantify all levels of what a human is. It is for that reason that we feel compelled to say this test is not a diagnosis, but rather an enjoyable experience for both you and us. If you score a lower or higher result than somebody else, this does not necessarily brand you as being in a certain category of people for the rest of your life. People have been shown to be able to learn any task once they are within the higher average range of intelligence. This is roughly 70% of the population. We pride ourselves on offering the most up to date website as well.


We believe that by learning new things every day, you can improve your cognitive function relative to those who don’t take time to learn new things, which is most people. The time taken in learning new tasks and the ability to learn new tasks generally becomes shorter as IQ increases, but it is not a predictor of how well you will do at those tasks once you have reached a given level of fluency in them. There have been quite brilliant people with outstanding accomplishments throughout history, including but not limited to the 35th president of the United States, John F Kennedy, who had an IQ of exactly 100. Overall, brilliance has more to do with your level of effort and commitment to reaching a goal and bringing that same goal to tangible fruition. In jobs where learning and constant adaptation to new tasks every day is a necessity, a higher IQ becomes more relevant. However, keep in mind that IQ scores on this site are relative to a population size that grows larger every day. As we collect more results, (don’t worry, we don’t collect things like your name or address) our test will become more accurate overtime.
