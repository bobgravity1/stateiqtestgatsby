Our IQ test is unique, because we measure a variety of different variables to come to our final score. We also seek to approve our accuracy over time, this test is adaptive and thus your results during one time period when compared to another are subject to change slightly to ensure ultimate accuracy. One of the things we place emphasis on is quality and detail, as opposed to the generic results and explanations encountered with many other online IQ tests. The end user of our product is prioritized on our website, and we donâ€™t force you to pay for results that are difficult to understand or not complete enough to be worth the price charged. All users of stateIQtest are entitled to a free score range, showing your IQ in a range accurate to 15 points. Upon the optional purchase of our Cognitive Analysis, you will receive your exact IQ score, a breakdown of your result in different categories of intelligence, as well as being able to see what you got right and wrong. Below [or to the right] is a small sample shown of what that looked like for one of our early test users.

## History of IQ
No, IQ is not everything. Individuals can strive to achieve varying degrees of competency at almost any single task. We are limited however, in the finite amount of time, prior competency/experience, and by our individual upbringing. Various factors have been correlated with higher or lower IQ scores, including single motherhood, participation in crime, and job performance. The data appears to show causality as well, though it does not seem clear where and when this begins, and this does not account for outliers. IQ, though it is not entirely irrelevant, it is not the only thing to consider when hiring someone for a job, which is why using IQ tests is actually illegal in this capacity. Griggs v. Duke Power Company resultsed in a decision by the Supreme Court to ultimately ban this practice as it was a violation of the 1964 Civil Right Act.
