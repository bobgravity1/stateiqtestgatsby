Our IQ test is unique, because we measure many different variables to come to our final score. We also seek to improve our accuracy over time, this test is adaptive and thus your results during one time period when compared to another are subject to change slightly to ensure ultimate accuracy. One of the things we place emphasis on is quality and detail, as opposed to the generic results and explanations encountered with many other online IQ tests. The end user of our product is prioritized on our website, and we don’t force you to pay for results that are difficult to understand or not complete enough to be worth the price charged. All users of stateIQtest are entitled to a free score range, showing your IQ in a range accurate to 15 points. Upon the optional purchase of our Cognitive Analysis, you will receive your exact IQ score, a breakdown of your result in different categories of intelligence, as well as being able to see what you got right and wrong. Below [or to the right] is a small sample shown of what that looked like for one of our early test users.

Our IQ test on average takes 25 minutes to complete. Our IQ test is not timed, so take as much time as you need. If you’d like to use pen and paper, you may do so only when you feel it is absolutely required. Use of a pen and paper will not affect your final score.

Long term research suggests that those who suffer from brain injuries may retain their crystallized knowledge, but their fluid IQ could plummet. In recent years there have been various reports of people having had traumatic brain injuries being able to increase their intelligence so long as their brain is still in development. It was believed for a long time that improvements on born intelligence were not possible, that they were fixed, if not from birth then from a certain age of foundational brain development. However, newer reports have suggested that improvements on intelligence and conduct is possible at any age, of people in any occupation or without one, and at any level of educational achievement.


## History of IQ

Historical examples of various attempts to classify people by the categorization of their intellectual capacity were limited to observation of their accomplishments and behaviour regarding their conduct in daily life. There was no standard, however, which led to confusion as to what intelligence meant from a psychological perspective. If you consider psychology to be a science, then there are obvious limitations in testing any variable in that way, same as there would be by having people only take written tests. One of the first experimentally tested attempts of quantifying intelligence was in 1882, where English statistician Francis Galton developed the first establishment for mental competency evaluation in the world. The basis for this testing was that there existed a causal link between intelligence as well as a variety of observable traits such as head size, muscle grip and reflexes. After failing to show any correlation between the tested variables and scores of competency, Francis Galton eventually abandoned this method of research. It wasn’t until 1905, that two French psychologists by the name of Alfred Binet and Victor Henri first published the Binet-Simon Test. The main measurement used for this test was linguistic and verbal ability. The overall goal of this test was to identify mental retardation in school children; and also to test the prevailing theory that those who suffered from mental retardation or intellectual disability should be cared for in asylums.


Though Binet believed that within the topic of intelligence existed a multifaceted field of study, he also believed that there were limitations to the scale and thus he stressed the importance of qualitative research; as opposed to quantitative research in psychological and cognitive assessment. He felt that to use the IQ test as the only measurement of intelligence was to severely limit our understanding of psychology. The idea that what makes a human a human, complex creatures as we are, is so much more than is able to be quantifiable measured, stated and tested, and therefore one can only conclude that intelligence is no different from any uniquely human trait.

This test was late revisited and thus revised to become named the Binet Intelligence Scales in 1916, after which it became the most popular test in the United States for several years. Since then, variations of the IQ test has been used countless times throughout history. Famous examples include during World War 1, when the US Army required a fast and organized way of calculating and assigning tasks to appropriate military personnel. This prompted the first large scale development of several different tests of mental acuity, in which Robert Yerkes, was assigned the task of writing the test. At the time, national attempts to test the public were met with controversy and even a lot of debate within the US about the validity of standardized testing in assessing intelligence. Nonetheless, from that point on began the slow adaptation and continuation of these IQ tests in Army recruitment, workplace assessment and school placement.

One of the reasons for the controversy of this particular IQ test, was that the results of the IQ test reaffirmed what at the time were presumed assumptions about racial superiority and the heredity of intelligence. It is primarily for this reason that IQ is considered as being controversial, though it really should not be because it has been adapted to accurately measure your processing speed of various mental tasks, and the complexity at which you are able to think. Nonetheless, these tests were considered as being true and accurate measures of intelligence by the public and thus they reinforced arguments for racial segregation as well as contemporary ideas about race in general. This is one of the reasons why IQ is deemed as being controversial to this day, and the innate proclivity that exists against the field and study of psychology in general.

## Examples of IQ Today

Some of the more commonly known tests are the SAT, ACT, and the ASVAB. All of these are IQ tests, with results intended to determine what level of work you are capable of doing. These are important measures in our society because they provide us with an understanding of how intelligence effects the conduct of people in the real world. Though IQ testing for jobs is actually illegal in most countries, using IQ tests as a predictor of workplace performance still continues under different names. Though employers are legally prevented from giving IQ tests to employees and from using them for workplace recruitment, they can get around this by giving their potential employees an IQ test under a different name, most notably of which being the Wonderlic Test. Because this test is not called an IQ test, it is ‘technically’ not attempting to assess peoples intelligence, it is instead a test to indicate your ‘workplace performance’ and thus can legally be used for these purposes.

IQ tests like the SAT, ACT and the ASVAB are not called IQ tests either, and thus they can be used for purposes of induction and recruitment. However, these are disguised as ‘aptitude tests,’ which essentially allow for IQ to be stated in a different way and thus careful enough to not cross over the line of being controversial. These tests, while predictors of performance, also serve to find which role may be best suited to you. This follows the original intent of the IQ test, which was to make a quantifiable measure of intelligence for purposes of military induction. Among IQ tests, other metrics were used for these purposes, however they were less prominent and therefore less applicable to be mentioned for our purposes.
