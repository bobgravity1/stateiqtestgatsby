## Why does IQ matter?
The same psychologists who played a key role in the development of the IQ test also played a key role in the formation of the basis of some of the methods of statistical research used to test all psychological hypotheses today. This does not give authority to the IQ test, but rather the IQ test gives modern day psychology it’s authority. This is the fundamental psychological concept we want to ensure is noted and improved upon by having you take this test.

## Is IQ everything?
No, IQ is not everything. Individuals can strive to achieve varying degrees of competency at almost any single task. We are limited however, in the finite amount of time, prior competency/experience, and by our individual upbringing. Various factors have been correlated with higher or lower IQ scores, including single motherhood, participation in crime, and job performance. The data appears to show causality as well, though it does not seem clear where and when this begins, and this does not account for outliers. IQ, though it is not entirely irrelevant, it is not the only thing to consider when hiring someone for a job, which is why using IQ tests is actually illegal in this capacity. Griggs v. Duke Power Company resulted in a decision by the Supreme Court to ultimately ban this practice as it was found to be a violation of the 1964 Civil Right Act.

## Do I need a high IQ to be successful?
You absolutely do not need a high IQ to be successful. What you do need however, is a drive to succeed in a certain area. Research suggests that IQ is less relevant to job performance than effort and commitment. This does not mean that having a higher IQ will not help you in performing or even learning new tasks, but it is less relevant to your overall success in a certain area than was once thought amongst the psychological community. Having a higher IQ will generally give you an advantage in a number of fields, although it is not the deciding factor in whether you do well or not.

## What about the Wonderlic test? Is the Wonderlic test an IQ test?
The Wonderlic test is not an IQ test, in the same way that Steve Jobs did not invent the iPhone. Because it is not called an IQ test, it is officially known as the ‘Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test’, it is not an IQ test and is therefore legal for use as an assessment of workplace performance. However, make no mistake, the Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test is an IQ test under a different name.

## Why the brain?
The human brain is undoubtedly one of the most complex things in existence, and we believe that it should never be left to rot. We believe that expanding our brain function to new areas of study is deeply intertwined with the active pursuance of self-fulfilment. Whether it be in one area or another, nearly everybody strives to be competent at tasks, each with varying degrees of commitment, interest and primary focus. The brain is both a beautiful and frighteningly complex organ, this is why we place an extra focus on its health and function, where it is too often neglected. It’s also why you’ll find a brain on everything we do.

## Is Race connected to IQ?
No, but culture certainly is. Past “research” (we use that term loosely, these were largely untested hypothesis that became prevailing thought) suggested that certain races have an innate disadvantage when it comes to learning. This is an obviously harmful way of thinking, as it opens the door for a long history of mistreating those who are deemed to be less intellectual than those who deem themselves as superior. We know today that IQ is not connected to racial background, but it is influenced by the environment that you grow up in. For example, if you live in a household where studying and intellectual conversations are encouraged, the likelihood that you will perform better relative to the wider population in any intellectual pursuit is increased tremendously. In contrast, if you grow up in a household with limited intellectual stimulation, violence and/or abuse of illicit substances or alcohol, your likelihood of reaching the level of success that you are capable of is stifled. To sum it up, IQ is not connected to race, however racial differences in IQ can be mostly ascribed to differences across both culture and uncontrollable environmental factors regarding learning, study and focus, as well as access to and encouraged engagement with educational material.

## What is Donald Trump’s IQ?
Donald Trump brought the subject of IQ to the forefront of the political debates of both 2016 and 2020. The US presidents attempt to do so brought criticisms, which varied from the dismissal of IQ tests entirely, to the possibility of it leaving the door open for arguments from authority. However, president Donald Trump’s officially stated IQ score is 160, the highest attainable score. Upon request of him to try our test, he has yet to respond.

## Are there different kinds of intelligence? If so, how many?
Yes, research has suggested that there are up to eight different kinds of intelligence. Naturalistic, Musical, Logical–mathematical, Existential, Interpersonal, Linguistic, Bodily–kinaesthetic, Intra–personal and Spatial intelligence. However, many of these cannot be quantified by the results of a test. Prolonged observation would in theory allow for professional assessment of someone’s “IQ” in these areas, but it would still not allow for a quantifiable IQ test score, or at least not expressed the way we know IQ score to mean. The only intelligences that can be objectively measured in the way of an IQ test is logical mathematical and linguistic ability.

## Is this IQ test free?
Yes! Our IQ test is completely free to take. We pride ourselves on offering the best free online IQ test out there. We do however have an option to pay for a more extensive result, in which instead of receiving your score range accurate to 15 points you will receive an exact score and a breakdown of each of the three categories of intelligence that we measure. This is currently priced at 2.99 and helps us to keep our site up and running. The three kinds of intelligence that we measure in our online IQ test are spatial intelligence, logical thinking/reasoning ability and linguistic ability. Many other online IQ tests are lacking in their capability to measure several different kinds of intelligence, being that they either claim to measure too many and thus lose accuracy or they do not even begin to delve into a breakdown of your strengths and weaknesses.

## How can I pay for this IQ test?
We currently have one method of payment for our IQ test service, and that is by Debit/Credit Card. All of our payments are handled by Stripe, a third party payment processing service. If you have further questions about how we handle our payments, please scroll down to find the contact form and submit a query. We offer 24/7 assistance with all of our customers, so feel free to reach out anytime. Due to a large backlog of emails, please allow up to 24 hours for a response. We are currently working to allow for multiple forms of payment, including PayPal, Square and CashApp.

## Should I be afraid of stateIQtest?
Definitely not. Consider it to be a new challenge. There is nothing to lose if you are one of those people who want to know themselves better or measure their skills. It is a chance to get a proper evaluation of psychologist-supervised intelligence. Tests and their conclusions are handled anonymously, unless, of course, you want to let others know!

## Can I improve my IQ?
Research suggests that you can’t improve your IQ in later life/adulthood. Intelligence is a personality trait affected by both genetic and environmental factors. The creation of good genetic conditions is mainly caused by diet, a stimulus-rich climate and a number of neonatal, baby and childhood experiences. Up to about the age of 24 our cognitive skills will grow, and our level of intellect will differ from this cap little after that. It is necessary to note that on any given test, there is a disparity between one's IQ and the outcome. Test planning and brainstorming will have a slight positive impact on the test outcome; likewise, you can get a bad test result if you are exhausted, sick or suffering from loss of focus when you are tested, but the intelligence ratio will not change dramatically. Cognitive preparation will also play an important part, even in old age, in retaining our knowledge and intellectual ability.

## Why is having a high IQ beneficial in my everyday life?
Knowledge also involves the capability of successfully solving a problem or solving a set of problems in our lives. It is good for all to solve challenges more easily and more successfully, to understand conditions faster. This would allow more time for those items that are beneficial, more productive in life, and so on. But for what, what is more valuable, what is called successful, what kind of challenge is turning their knowledge around, there is no general response or formula, everyone has to answer.

## Are knowledge and intelligence the same?
Although the two are not the same, these two terms are frequently misunderstood and used interchangeably. Intelligence is an acquired characteristic that is interpreted in many respects by many individuals, but by studying, information is obtained. It is this retainment of information that is called knowledge, whereas intelligence is a general approximation of what you have the capability to learn. There may be an approximate connection between the two: an educated person is not always extremely intelligent, but someone who is very intelligent is more likely to be open to new ideas, more informed, more curious about the environment, and what has been read or learned will typically be easier to recall. Having someone that is smart but not clearly trained/educated is not unusual.

## What should I do if my child is smart?
Parents contact Mensa sometimes, asking us to assess the intellect of their child. Unfortunately, the assessment of small children demands that a psychologist who specializes in such testing perform an individual test and Mensa does not actually have the facility to conduct advanced assessments for children. However, we do consider psychologists' qualifying examination findings, and several national Mensa groups have reported successful programs for younger participants. It can be demanding and difficult to nurture the talent of kids who reach the stages of development quickly. In the 'Recognizing talent' section of this website, there is further advice on this topic. We will often encourage parents in their district to search out an educational specialist where our services will no longer suffice. In the future, we seek to provide not only basic test results, but real, online, comprehensive, conscientious and thorough psychological evaluations to everybody, free of charge. stateIQtest.org in its current state is just one of many steps to get there. All of our tests and their results are individualized and improve themselves overtime, with the intention of using these results in order to shift our most basic level of our current understanding to encompass many different areas.
