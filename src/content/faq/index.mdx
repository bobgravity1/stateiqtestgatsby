## Why does IQ matter?
The same psychologists who played a key role in the development of the IQ test also played a key role in the formation of the basis of some of the methods of statistical research used to test all psychological hypotheses today. This does not give authority to the IQ test, but rather the IQ test gives modern day psychology itâ€™s authority. This is the fundamental psychological concept we want to ensure is noted and improved upon by having you take this test.

## Is IQ everything?
No, IQ is not everything. Individuals can strive to achieve varying degrees of competency at almost any single task. We are limited however, in the finite amount of time, prior competency/experience, and by our individual upbringing. Various factors have been correlated with higher or lower IQ scores, including single motherhood, participation in crime, and job performance. The data appears to show causality as well, though it does not seem clear where and when this begins, and this does not account for outliers. IQ, though it is not entirely irrelevant, it is not the only thing to consider when hiring someone for a job, which is why using IQ tests is actually illegal in this capacity. Griggs v. Duke Power Company resultsed in a decision by the Supreme Court to ultimately ban this practice as it was a violation of the 1964 Civil Right Act.
