## 5 The Chernobyl Disaster resulted in a growing population of radioactive wild boars!

Although it has been over 30 years since the Chernobyl Disaster today, in 2014 
radioactive wild boars were found, which are believed to have originated from the subsequent 
radioactive cloud that spread to the rest of Europe following the initial disaster. 1/3 wild 
boars in the area are believed to be radioactive!

## 4 People have since planted hemp to remove toxins from the soil in the surrounding areas.
In a process known as Phytoremediation, people in the surrounding areas of Chernobyl have planted hemp seeds with the hopes that the plant will be able to clean up the surrounding air, soil and water.

## 3 The ruling Soviet Authorities kept the disaster a secret.
When Gorbachev was awoken at around 5:00AM, he was informed of the following message: There had been an explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but the reactor was intact.
Gorbachev claimed he had been informed that there had been a fire, but no explosion at the Chernobyl power plant, so- he saw no reason to panic, being as it was a Saturday, with no reason to interrupt the weekend.

## 2 The Swedish came forth to inform the world about the disaster.
The nation of Sweden, in the Forsmark Plant north of Stockholm, a man who passed radiation detection instruments and revealed to have a higher than normal radiation level.
Upon examination of logistics, it was found that the most likely culprit was in fact a different power plant located in the Ukraine, Chernobyl.
Gorbachav took 2 days after this to inform the public of what had indeed happened.”

## 1 Biodiversity following the incident has boomed!

In a case of accidental good fortune, even rare species such as the lynx and the vulnerable European Bison have seen a massive resurgence in these areas
Wolves have also increased seven fold. It is unclear exactly why this has happened, although researchers suspect the lack of humans in the area is the primary cause of this.
Of the largest animal populations that have seen a resurgence in the area, beavers appear to have thrived, as well as horses and various endangered species abound which were thought to have been on their way to extinction.
As stated by Marina Shkvyria, a wolf expert at the Ukraine’s National Academy of Sciences, “We came down here late last spring and howled, and the young wolf pups howled back from the top of the hill.
However, scientists are still divided as to the causes and validity of thinking that Chernobyl’s animal population has thrived since the aftermath of the disaster.
