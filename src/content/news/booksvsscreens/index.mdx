Books vs screens - Which is better for information retention?

We conducted an experiment between two volunteer test groups, who henceforth will be referred to as Test group A and Test group B.


Everyone in each of groups chose to remain anonymous by their own choice.

Both groups of people consisted of 2 females and 2 males, all in the age ranges of 24-28. 

Both test groups were college educated and had all attained bachelors degrees at the same college, but each had different majors. 

Test group A all had a tested IQ average of 123, and did all of their reading from a screen. 3 people in test group A had also confided that they had not read a physical book since they had left college.


Test group B also had a tested IQ average of 123, they did most of their reading from a screen as well, but stated that they still made an effort to read from physical books.


Both test groups were asked to read the same small piece of writing from paper, consisting of 1000 words. Afterwards, both Test groups were given a series of questions on their comprehension of what 
they had just read, as well as being told to report a synopsis of the text.


Different texts of the same length was conducted on screens, in which:
Group B had retained an average of 10% more of the text, in comparison to Group A who had difficulty remembering certain details.
What does this tell us about reading from a screen, and reading in general?


The exercise was repeated on screens, which showed that the retention level had dropped by a lesser amount, but was still present by an average of 5%. This expresses
the level of reading comprehension between those who mostly read on screens vs those who also read in their spare time.


Well, we now hypothesize that reading from screens is associated with skipping over certain details, and mere scanning as 
opposed to the deep focus required by reading. This makes sense considering what we already know about reading from social 
media, certain details have to be left out due to an abundance of information flowing at you. What the specific impact of 
social media has on this decrease in terms of our attention span is currently unknown, and will remain as such until we 
conduct further experiments to deduce what specifically causes differences in reading comprehension ability, and the exact 
effect that this may have on IQ scores.


Of course, we are far more concerned with real world abilities and the deveoplment and nurturing of them than with what an IQ test can tell us considering the current 
limitations of IQ tests in quantifying intellect.


But because we are intent on being thorough and are dealing with the limitations of too small a sample size to draw a definitive conclusion, we repeated the experiment one more time at a later
date with different groups of people that all shared the same vital requirements for eligibility, age, gender, and IQ range.


The results were similar, but it brought our average difference between reading comprehension in both groups down to about 12%- once again giving preference to the group who had read physical
books over those who did not.


This is still a substantial difference in terms of the ability to retain information.


By this time, it was decided that we should really put the idea of born intellect to the test.


The experiment was repeated, this time with only one group. This group, which will henceforth be referred to as test group C, shared all of the same physical attributes, but they tested at 
a higher level than the previous groups. The only differing variable in test group C when compared to the other two was that the average IQ score was tested at 135. All of test group C also
had not read a book for at least 1 year.


We were surprised that their reading comprehension levels all varied quite drastically, with those who had gone the longest without reading a physical book having the hardest time at long term recall.
On average, when discounting for one seeming outlier who scored extremely high when tested individually compared to all other subjects in all of the test groups, it was found that they scored 2% lower than those who
had a lower IQ, but said they had not read a book in at least 1 year.


The results of this experiment would normally serve to reinforce what many already believe, that where information is concerned, it is easier to retain information that is read on paper. 
This is not a conclusive argument, as we must conduct other studies to allow us to research this further before drawing any definitive conclusions.
