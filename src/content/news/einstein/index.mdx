**Besides** click [here](/readus/andrewarticle) being able to achieve a great many things in their lifetime, 
they all had abnormal sleeping patterns when compared to the average population. 
However, what defines this as an abnormality may not be what you expect. You 
would probably expect that these people dedicated immense bursts of time to their 
work, waking at early hours and collapsing on the floor at night. Not so, says history.
The surprising conundrum results from the fact that all of these people took regular 
naps. Thatâ€™s right. Napping is not just for babies and the lazy.


Albert Einstein, renowned for his work in physics and mathematics, was 
known to take both regular naps as well as occasionally falling asleep in 
his chair while holding a pencil or a spoon. However, what separates Einstein 
from a levy of other regular nappers, is that he regularly also attained 10 
hours of sleep. Eleanor Roosevelt would often take short naps prior to giving a 
speech. She stated that this helped to improve her mood, fill her with energy 
and power the mind. She is not alone in this, as Winston Churchill; another 
historical figure renowned for his speaking ability reportedly did the same thing. 
Leonardo Da Vinci had perhaps the most peculiar sleeping pattern of the lot. He regularly 
took naps everyday, sometimes stopping every four hours to take a nap. 
So, what gives? Is everything I was told about getting a good nights sleep before an important day a lie?


Well, not entirely. Sleep, in particular uninterrupted REM sleep is very important 
for brain development and knowledge and memory retainment. There are 3 basic stages 
of sleep before you can fully enter an REM sleep cycle. Each of these 3 stages can 
last anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.


In stage 1, you have just started to drift off to sleep. You are still aware of your
surroundings, even if only slightly so. Waking someone during this time is easy.
At stage 2, you have now entered the phase of light sleep. You can still be awoken 
quite easily, though the parts of your brain responsible for processing your surroundings have mostly shut down.
By stage 3, you have now entered the phase of deep sleep. Contrary to popular consensus, 
deep sleep is not the same as REM sleep. During this time, your breathing rate has slowed 
and your muscles will have relaxed themselves to allow for repair.


It is only now that you will reach REM sleep. REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement. 
Breathing becomes shallow and rapid, as your blood pressure and heart rate increase.
One of the creepy things about REM sleep is that the arms and legs are paralyzed 
during this time to ensure that we do not act out our dreams. (We think!)

REM typically occurs around an hour and a half after you first enter sleep cycle stage 1. 
It is during this time that your brain pauses to process all of the information that you
have absorbed throughout the preceding day. It also sorts and stores the relevant parts of 
this information, and discards whatever is deemed to be not needed that might be stored anyways.

It is by this selective process that the brain decides to absorb information. 
If you absorb more of a certain kind of information, your brain will selectively 
shift to display more of this information to you during your sleep. This is noted
by the common occurrence among recovering drug addicts, in which they may find that
they have dreams of their drug use or imagined drug use through a process known as 
euphoric recall. Typically, a sleeping person will go through several REM cycles 
throughout their sleep. It is not abnormal for someone to 
have multiple REM cycles in one sleep session. For information about the impact of 
alcohol and other drugs on REM sleep, please click here.
