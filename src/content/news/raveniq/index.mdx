According to Nature Electronics, a new development has allowed for severed pieces of Venus fly traps to be able to grasp things on command.
Though plants are devoid of any sort of IQ, or certainly IQ as we know it today, this development has shown the massive 
capability of the human brain to command the body to alter its surroundings to better suit itself.
The device contains the vital parts of Venus fly traps that enable them 
to close when stimulated. Typically, this carnivorous plant is able to 
shut itself when prompted by one or more of the plants small and delicate 
hairs being stimulated. However, the research done by nature Electronics 
showed that they were able to stimulate this response irrespective of the 
plant being “alive”, by inserting electrodes within the plant itself; allowing
for this natural response to continue on command for up to a day after the plant 
had already been dead.

The hope is that eventually we will be able to use this plant material in order 
to aid the research and development of robotics, in which we are currently limited.
There are still a myriad of issues within the field of robotics, such as the inherent 
limitations to using something like steel to pick up a delicate object. However, if we were able to integrate soft and organic material into the design of these robots, we 
would fare much better in our ability to use them for these purposes. It is for this reason 
that the research team decided to test their theory, and were pleasantly surprised by the 
results of the experiment. The results of the experiment found that by controlling electrical  
impulses through the use of a smartphone, they were able to have the robot clutch a tiny piece 
of wire less than one millimeter in diameter. A truly astounding feat, which shows that there is 
great potential for future research in this area.

However, we don’t think it will be anytime soon that you see Venus fly traps being used for this purpose in a practical matter, as the Venus fly traps still take several hours to reopen after closing shut, regardless of any additional electronic stimulus.
