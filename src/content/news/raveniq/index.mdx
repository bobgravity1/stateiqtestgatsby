Ravens are well known for their above average intelligence, relative to the rest of the animal kingdom. Ravens are far 
from your typical bird, and this recent study conducted by animal cognition researchers Can Kabadayi and Mathias Osvath
at Sweden's Lund University has confirmed this as well. Obviously, there are limitations when attempting to define 
intelligence among animals, just as there are in humans. There exists no IQ test for animals that are not human, 
as having an appropriate biological proclivity in certain areas is a much stronger factor in deciding the success 
of a species that is not human than it is to have reason and the ability to make logical deductions. Therefore, 
most attempts to quantify the intelligence or IQ of animals has been done through observation, 
the same way it was done for humans prior to the invention of the IQ test.


During a study conducted in 2017 however, ravens were shown to outperform primates and
even children at logical deduction and pattern recognition.
The study, intended to find the reasoning skills/IQ of Ravens was conducted as follows,
The research team showed the ravens that if the birds were to place a special object in a
specific way within a box, they would be rewarded with a treat. (The treat in this instance was a
piece of dog kibble, which is enjoyed by Ravens almost as much as dogs)
This experiment however, if conducted without changing any of the aforementioned variables
would have shown nothing new, as it is already established that ravens are able to follow
directions, better sometimes than children.
However, when the research team waited for a full hour before retesting them again, they were
pleasantly surprised as they found that 80% of the Ravens were able to recall the correct object
and receive more treats.
A remarkable finding, as even primates and children were unable to effectively recall this far,
never mind using what they recalled to draw a new conclusion. 


To test this, a nearly identical experiment (adjusted for differences in biology and opposable thumbs), 
showed us that the ravens were able to outperform both human children and primates.


Another experiment suggested that ravens are able to use their remarkable capabilities to
barter. This experiment tested the ability of ravens to exchange marked tokens for different
foods at different times, of which the experiment showed a success rate of upwards of 90%.
Though these are not capabilities that are used in the wild for ravens, this made it all the more
remarkable that these birds were able to accurately make decisions that impact their future.
All of our experience with other animals shows that with the exception of certain primates, acting
outside of their biological constructs which steer their innate proclivities is detrimental to the
species and therefore should not be continued.
However, ravens are different, and their differences have shown themselves repeatedly in any
attempt to quantify their ability to learn new things and to process relevant information. The
ability alone to decide what is relevant and what is not relevant and to use that information to
plan for the future is really and truly quite remarkable.
Though we are still unable to quantify the intelligence of ravens into a measurable and clearly
laid out IQ score, we can use what we now know in order to make better decisions about the future of
these animals.
