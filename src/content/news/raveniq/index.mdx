Ravens are well known for their above average intelligence, relative to the rest of the animal kingdom. Ravens are far 
from your typical bird, and this recent study conducted by animal cognition researchers Can Kabadayi and Mathias Osvath
at Sweden's Lund University has confirmed this as well. Obviously, there are limitations when attempting to define 
intelligence among animals, just as there are in humans. There exists no IQ test for animals that are not human, 
as having an appropriate biological proclivity in certain areas is a much stronger factor in deciding the success 
of a species that is not human than it is to have reason and the ability to make logical deductions. Therefore, 
most attempts to quantify the intelligence or IQ of animals has been done through observation, 
the same way it was done for humans prior to the invention of the IQ test.
