Many people at the individual level describe intellect in their own image. 
It is described by engineers in terms that characterize a successful engineer. 
It is described by artists in ways which describe a great artist. Scientists, 
businesspeople, and athletes all do the same. A good academic psychologist will
possibly be defined by my description. In these descriptions, there is substantial
variation but still considerable convergence. It is the repetition that justifies 
the usage of the folk word intelligence in the meanings. The contradictions in the
different meanings, however, are true and therefore enable the word intelligence 
to remain vague in order to satisfy the needs of the people who use it. I do not say 
that it is a primitive notion in need of an update when defining knowledge as a folk term.
Several folk ideas are extremely complicated and dynamic. They need not be converted 
into formal scientific terms any more than it is appropriate to rewrite folk songs as 
operas. Of course, just as folk songs have been used in operas, folk ideas may remind 
each other, but they do not necessarily need to inform each other. For this reason, 
since groups of psychologists constantly differ on the concept of intelligence, I 
want to dispense with the trope that there is something fishy in the subdiscipline of 
intelligence study. It is not necessary for them to consent, and we do not ask them to 
do so. If they did agree, the precise concept settled upon would be an arbitrary option 
that would not be binding on any other psychologist (or anyone else). It is the essence 
of folk concepts; the folk who use them are flexibly, easily, and mutually defining their interpretations, and folk may change their minds.In addition, stating that this is a folk concept does not indicate that it is not true or that it is not important; many of the phrases we use to describe people refer to folk concepts that most of us consider to be quite real and very important. Intelligence is quite true, too, and it's very necessary! In fact, by definition, it is vital that we use the phrase to identify people who are able to learn valuable knowledge and who can use a mixture of reasoning, intuition, imagination experience, and intelligence to solve consequential problems.

What he has Done:
See what I've just done there? With a bunch of words that are almost as ambiguous as the thing I'm trying to describe, I tried to characterize intellect. Terms such as useful information and consequential topics are, of course, abstractions that only take on clear meanings in particular cultural contexts. However, if you and I have a similar interpretation of all those ambiguous terms, we will understand each other. Our folk ideas transmit valuable knowledge if we are from the same people.

What do IQ tests test?
Other than what they calculate, the value of IQ tests is determined by what they compare with. As organizational meanings of hypotheses that happened to coincide with important findings, IQ tests did not begin. The reasoning that IQ experiments associate with so many substantial findings is that they have undergone a long period close to natural choosing. The quickest way to disapprove of the idea that Binet invented the first intelligence test is to read Binet's works himself, including showing you the test objects that he borrowed from scholars who came before him! Good test items are kept for each new test and each test modification, and poor test items are dropped. In each population on which the test is meant to be used, successful test items have strong associations with significant outcomes. For nothing except other test objects, poor items compare. Some test elements must be excluded because they have dramatically differing associations with findings around population subgroups, allowing, at the expense of other groups, the studies to be skewed in favor of other groups.

What Happens When IQ Tests Misses the Mark:
From time to time, it is in their essence to miss the target. If, because of incompetence, the score was incorrect, we should be upset with inexperienced test managers. To excuse injustice, we should be furious at organizations that use IQ tests. However, whether a qualified, loving, and attentive clinician has received the grossly wrong test score, we have to recognize that there are limitations to what can be known. These limitations are recognized by skilled, compassionate, and diligent practitioners and their confusion is factored into their interpretations and into any judgments made based upon on these interpretations. The institution should have processes in place to detect its errors if an institution uses test results to make high-stakes decisions (e.g., occasional re-evaluations).
