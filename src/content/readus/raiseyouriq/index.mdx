## 5 Ways to Increase your IQ


### Playing chess
Chess requires use of the prefrontal cortex, this is the part of the brain that is primarily used to make high level decisions. 
On a purely neurological level, playing chess positively promotes the usage of various mechanisms that are aided by the prefrontal cortex, such as 
pattern recognition, planning, judgement and self control. Using these mechanisms in the brain to accomplish real world tasks has long been accredited 
with helping to prompt further development within different parts of the brain- especially within the prefrontal cortex. It is generally agreed upon that
most people do not reach the full development stage of their prefrontal cortex until the approximate age of 24-- But this doesn't mean that your brain
will stop creating new connections at this point. It may just be harder to learn new things, especially if they are in an area that has not been studied
before- requiring usage of different parts of the brain to accomplish tasks. In addition, it also aids in memory and even has been shown to enhance 
reading comprehension. A 1991 study conducted by Dr. Stuart Margulies confirmed that students who had participated in a chess program had scored higher in
their level of reading comprehension than than those who hadn't- And another group from an area in which average children performed much lower than the normal level
and who had participated in a chess program experienced a significant rise in their scores of reading comprehension as well.

Additionally, many who have had an increase in their concrete abilities had also experienced stimulation of their neural connections, which prompted the people
in the study to experience an increase in their overall intellectual abilities as well.


### Art
Art prompts the usage of various brain functions for different people. It has shown to have an impact on the patterns of brain waves and the entire nervous system.
It can positively impact the patterns of brain waves- which can further stimulate brain function and neuroconnectivity. You dont have to neccesarily create art to
experience benefits from art either! Brain scans have shown that when looking at a piece of art one enjoys or thinks is beautiful, that blood flow to the brain
can increase by up to 10%, which is the equivalent to looking at a loved one- also beneficial to brain development and higher level cognitive functions.
This increase in blood flow allows for faster and more effective brain development- as it positively aids in neuron connectivity. It also stimulates the function and
usage of the interior insula and the putamen in positive ways. The interior insula is one of the components of the brain that is responsible for the experience of 
pleasant emotions; the putamen has ties to the experience of reward- an obviously vital part to brain function in nearly every stage of life. The two of these sectors
of the brain are triggered by viewing art- and we know that nearly any part of your body that is used frequently becomes stronger overtime. In addition, viewing and 
appreciating art can result in a mild elevation of serotonin levels- changing their outlook and experience of the world. However, as good as appreciating art is for
your brain- research has suggested that the largest benefits come from actually producing art. It can also aid in the usage and development of motor skills.


### Social Activities
Studies into the effects of social activities have shown that interacting with others can train your brain to improve memory formation and recall, both of which are
positively associated with preventing many neurodegenerative diseases. As interesting of a phenomenon that it is, it makes sense from both a biological and evolutionary
viewpoint. Human's primate ancestors benefited massively from socialization, as socialization by means of developing methods of more effective communication 
slowly became a vital tool for surival. Though it is less of a survival mechanism now in terms of function, social skills and the development of them is still vital
to success in later stages of life- responsible for many of our cognitive functions beyond the range of just socialization. Early hominids developed primitive languages
which were used to communicate in more advanced ways to express ideas of a higher complexity and helped our ancestors to develop higher level thinking in a variety
of areas. Also, increased social communication skills can improve empathy and the ability to care for eachother, both of which are highly beneficial to procreation,
as they foster the ability to care and share with each other which is vital to successfully raising children to deal with tasks they may encounter in a world that depends increasingly on
effective communication.


### Reading & Writing
Reading is important to brain development- and it is shown that those who are literate (people whom have the ability to read and effectively comprehend what is read) process
information differently than those who are illiterate. By exercising your brain by reading, you can actually improve the function of your angular and
supramarginal gyrus. These two parts of the brain serve as a conductor between the parts of the brain that are used during the action of reading. An interesting piece of this
knowledge is that our brains process reading from a book and reading from an electronic device quite differently. Read about our study into whether screens or books offer better
memory retention to readers.


### Maintaining a healthy diet
Maintaining a healthy diet is paramount to brain development and ongoing health. Healthy fats, such as those found in almonds, avacados, extra
virgin olive oil, cheese, dark chocolate, eggs and fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and herring) have all been shown to
have a positive impact on brain health. Healthy fats have a positive impact on brain health, because it acts as a sort of fuel for the brain.
Your brain is a fatty organ, and therefore requires healthy fats in order to properly function. Eating lots of healthy fat is also beneficial
for heart health, as well as mental health. We know that nutritional and vitamin deficiencies can also result in poorer mental health, as shown
by a variety of studies.
