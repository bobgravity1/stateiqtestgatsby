Euphoric recall is a process by which the brain selectively decides to recall information which is
associated with the pleasure receptors of the brain. A common occurence among recovering drug addicts,
in which they vividly recall/relive their most euphoric experiences through an entirely new one.


Often, the dreams will involve people they know, however there is almost always a twist.
In certain cases, those in recovery will remember their loved ones in precarious situations, such as
offering them drugs, taking drugs themselves or even buying/procuring drugs in a spot that the recovering
addict may recognize/associate with buying drugs, but not always. Oftentimes, the dreams are distorted
in the sense that they offer the recovering addict a moment of clarity by showing them different things
that they recognize clearly.


Of course, our memory, and our brains reconstruction of those memories by the process of REM sleep
is not always accurate. This is where the disconnect occurs, between what we know and what we believe 
to be true, but also sometimes entirely unrelated.
Euphoric recall is a process of the brains most internal systems, in which the brain recalls vivid and
oftentimes inaccurate memories (in the case of recovering drug addicts especially, as these memories are
deeply ingrained in the recovering addict. The brain then tries to associate them with something they recognize.

This can often cause confusion for recovering addicts/alcoholics, as they can't make sense why their brain would
remember oftentimes traumatic memories over newly found, and oftentimes better memories. The brain is such a 
complex organ that it will occasionally act outside of our best interests as a human being, especially when
living in modern times with all of the triggers and negative associations that can occur with living in these times.

Similar things have occured with people whom have had cellphone addictions, however this tends to happen
with less frequency and when awake. Several of our study group which consisted of those who had technology 
addictions (defined in this case by a repeated compulsion to use their phone, their computer, 
and also a sense of despair when said technology is no longer available.) 

However, when one removes themselves from their surroundings, similar triggers may occur between those who
use technology compulsively and those who used drugs compulsively. Beyond the chemical addiction, several
of those who considered themselves to be addicted to their cell phones reported 'phantom vibrations', the
occurance in which someone feels their phone buzzing/vibrating when they do not have a phone, and they seek 
to check it immediately only to meet the occurance of them having no phone, causing a sense of dispair and in
rare cases suicidal tendencies when they realize their phone is not readily available to them. 

Those with technology addictions can be differentiated from those with chemical addictions, however not entirely.
Both people with addictions to technology, as well as chemical dependancies each have shared traits, insofar
as their addiction is concerned. Both addicts will do short of anything to feed their addiction, however
in a world that increasingly relies on the use of technology disconnecting yourself from the technology addicts 
triggers and addicions is not expected, nor looked on favorably by those without a tendancy towards addictive 
behaviors. 

We also found that many of those who used technology compulsively, they expressed despair at the idea that others
do not understand their plight.
