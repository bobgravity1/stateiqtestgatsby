    'Many tests seek to measure what you already know. This is referred to as Crystallized IQ, or Crystallized Intelligence. Crystallized IQ can be expanded upon overtime, whereas Fluid IQ, or fluid intelligence/fluid reasoning classification attempts to measure what you have the capability to learn. Historical examples of various attempts to classify people by the categorization of their intellectual capacity were limited to observation of their accomplishments and behavior regarding their conduct in daily life. There was no standard, however, which led to confusion as to what intelligence meant from a psychological/scientific perspective. If you consider psychology to be a science, then there are obvious limitations in testing any variable in that way, same as there would be by having people only take written tests. Prior to the invention of the first IQ test, there was no viable way to measure intelligence (IQ), leading people to believe in many false presumptions about IQ and IQ tests; such as head size seen as showing a relation to intelligence, intelligence being routinely correlated with birth order, and left handed people being more intelligent than their right handed counterparts. All of these assumptions about intelligence are incorrect, some of which are still practiced in the world. We believe and maintain the idea that it is our duty to correct these errors. Not all of our research is related to IQ tests, however they make up a large part of our understanding where is is related to our available data. However, we also define/attempt to define the human condition by our understanding of what defines intelligence and also what causes certain proclivities towards negative behavior. One of the things we are hoping to accomplish in our mission is to be able to definitively quantify what should count as intelligence, vs what ideas we should discard- taking care to ensure that the initial findings of these studies are not compromised nor taken for granted, and all accounted for unless we are specifically trying to disprove a certain theory.',
    `IQ assessments have been performed for purposes of job recruitment, military service induction, and cases of identifying intellectual disability. IQ tests are performed to assess your intellectual ability, or your IQ; this is done by comparison of your test score relative to a wider population of data. If you score on the higher end on a test, it is an indication of your intellectual abilities relative to that area. Of the many abilities measured by IQ tests, including linguistic ability and numerical reasoning, general logic and pattern recognition, the extent to which your final IQ test score is reflective of your real world abilities tends to fall the more variables you try to measure. To solve this issue, we only measure three variables in coming to our overall IQ test score. All purchases of our IQ test service help to fund more of our research, test development, and helps to further ensure the continued validity of our test. For more information about purchasing our IQ test service, please do not hesitate to fill out the contact form and one of our representatives will get back to you shortly. The contact section can be also found at the bottom of the website. If you have scored as having an IQ test result within a certain unexpected range of intelligence, you should not take that as a reflection of what you can accomplish. The world is your oyster, and making IQ tests free and accessible to everybody is our specialty. Press/click the following link to read more about our research.`,
    `Many different IQ scores are calculated by comparing chronological age to mental age. What this means is if a five-year-old child hit the same stage as the typical eight-year-old child, he or she will have a mental age of eight years. Mental Age/Chronological Age x 100 was the original formula for finding intelligence quotient. A five-year-old who hit the same mark as his five-year-old peers will thereby score 100. The score of 100 has been held as the universal average score, and today it is still used. The average score on IQ tests increased across the world during the early years of testing. "The Flynn effect", named after Jim Flynn, who did much of the work to track and spread understanding of this phenomenon and its effects, is now called this rise. Many IQ tests are adjusted every few years for this reason. In order to keep the average score at 100; anyone who scored a 100 in the year 1950 would likely earn either a lower or higher score on one of today's IQ tests, depending on what test it is. We will update our tests every year for this reason. One of the first experimentally tested attempts of quantifying intelligence was in 1882, where English statistician Francis Galton developed the first establishment for mental competency evaluation in the world. The basis for this testing was that there existed a causal link between intelligence as well as a variety of observable traits such as head size, muscle grip and reflexes. After failing to show any correlation between the tested variables and scores of competency, Francis Galton eventually abandoned this method of research. It wasnâ€™t until 1905, that two French psychologists by the name of Alfred Binet and Victor Henri first published the Binet-Simon Test. The main measurement used for this test was linguistic and verbal ability. The overall goal of this test was to identify mental retardation in school children; and also to test the prevailing theory that those who suffered from mental retardation or intellectual disability should be cared for in asylums. Though Binet believed that within the topic of intelligence existed a multifaceted field of study, he also believed that there were limitations to the scale and thus he stressed the importance of qualitative research; as opposed to quantitative research in psychological and cognitive assessment. He felt that to use the IQ test as the only measurement of intelligence was to severely limit our understanding of psychology. The idea that what makes a human a human, complex creatures as we are, is so much more than is able to be quantifiable measured, stated and tested, and therefore one can only conclude that intelligence is no different from any uniquely human trait.`,
    `A fair measure of intelligence is a test which is relatively fair to all cultural communities. In the perception or use of a test to assess or diagnose, ensuring unilateral score distribution data is linked to a lack of prejudice. The validity of the explanation is comparable across different cultural communities in a non-culturally biased evaluation. Provided that the test material, vocabulary, instructions, and validity requirements are culturally bound, it is unlikely that any test will completely eradicate the impact of learning and cultural experience. Nevertheless, eliminating culturally loaded objects, items that are found to be discriminatory to such classes of persons; increasing the chance that it will be a culturally equal test. The chance of a culturally fair test is decreased by culturally loaded objects, such as those that use photographs or general data that are differentially prevalent within certain cultures. Of course, it can be difficult to ensure that the metrics that are being measured by the test in question do in fact hold no cultural proclivities, so it is for this reason that we do not claim to offer a culturally fair test. Certain elements which are measured by our test, such as spatial reasoning and logic, can be measured in such a way, however we currently are not yet able to offer a test that is considered as culturally fair, as the directions are in English. With that being stated, for a test to be considered as truly culturally fair, it must be devoid of any instruction as solving the test will be self-evident. Though intelligence is shared among many and countries and communities within those cultures around the world, what intelligence means for different people is entirely circumstantial. In a variety of real-world situations, intelligence is much more strongly linked to competency rather than mathematical or verbal quantifications of what we perceive intelligence to be in any given country or region. We all have strengths and weaknesses. It would be silly to think that every single one of these strengths weaknesses can be quantified by means of a written test, therefore we do not claim to. What we offer is a fun way to challenge yourself and to test your limitations and your cognitive capabilities.`
