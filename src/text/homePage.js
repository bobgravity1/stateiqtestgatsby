    'There are many different strengths to taking and completing an IQ test. One of the strengths of taking an IQ test is that it may offer unique and valuable knowledge that families or experts would not have picked up on or been able to explain regarding the intellectual progress of a young child. The assessments will also provide valuable evidence on how a child functions in response to multiple cognitive processes. This will help clinicians recognize particular areas of success for youngsters, as well as areas where they are not as strong in contrast. In the detection of potentially particular learning disabilities, mapping this pattern of strengths and any relative deficiencies will also help. An IQ test, for example, can help distinguish a child who is gifted, but who also has dyslexia or visual processing issues (dual exceptionality). IQ assessments that practitioners need to be mindful of still have limits. At the point of completing the exam, the evaluations offer a snapshot of the reactions of a pupil. Children could not show their complete ability on the evaluation for different reasons. The exam can disadvantage very young children who are shy, or those from poor or different cultural or non-English-speaking backgrounds. On the day when they take the IQ test, children may be sleepy, unwell, nervous or uncooperative. Furthermore, IQ assessments concentrate on assessing a specific spectrum of analytical skills. Therefore, they do not measure the technical or artistic ability of a child, or social maturity. For these purposes, in assessing the outcomes of an IQ evaluation of young children, caution must always be taken. It is possible to classify a child who scores highly on an IQ exam as gifted, but a child who does not score in the gifted category may also be gifted. Professionals may request the familys consent to read the data, however the report may include useful information with approval. Charles Spearman is often accredited as the founder of the idea that a single general intelligence factor is the underlying diverse cognitive functions, or what he called, ‘the G factor’. The G in this case is also known as General intelligence factor, general mental ability or sometimes just as General Intelligence. This G factor has a nearly 90% of positive correlation with IQ scores among the general population. This strong correlation means that if you know someones IQ score, you can use that to estimate their “G” and vice versa, with a high degree of accuracy. As a result of this, the two words are sometimes used interchangeably by those who perform and analyse the results of various psychometric tests.',
    `IQ assessments have been performed for purposes of job recruitment, military service induction, and cases of identifying intellectual disability. IQ tests are performed to assess your intellectual ability, or your IQ; this is done by comparison of your test score relative to a wider population of test score data. If you score on the higher end on a test, it is an indication of your intellectual abilities relative to that area. Of the many abilities measured by IQ tests, including linguistic ability and numerical reasoning, general logic and pattern recognition, the extent to which your final IQ test score is reflective of your real world abilities tends to fall the more variables you try to measure. To solve this issue, we only measure three variables in coming to our overall IQ test score.

This section can be found at the bottom of the website. If you have scored as having an IQ test result within a certain unexpected range of intelligence, you should not take that as a reflection of what you can accomplish. The world is your oyster, and making IQ tests free and accessible to everybody is our specialty. To read more about our research, click Research! IQ scores are measured by comparing chronological age to mental age. What this means is if a five-year-old child hit the same stage as the typical eight-year-old child, he or she will have a mental age of eight years. Mental Age/Chronological Age x 100 was the original formula for finding intelligence quotient. A five-year-old who hit the same amount as his five-year-old peers will thereby rate a hundred. The score of 100 has been the average score, and today it is still used. The average score on IQ tests increased across the world during the early years of testing. The "Flynn effect," named after Jim Flynn, who did much of the work to track and spread understanding of this phenomenon and its effects, is now called this rise. IQ tests are recalibrated every few years because of the Flynn effect to retain the average score at 100; as a result, anyone who scored a 100 in the year 1950 would likely earn a lower score on today's test.`,
    `A fair measure of intelligence is a test which is relatively fair to all cultural communities. In the perception or use of a test to assess or diagnose, ensuring unilateral score distribution data is linked to a lack of prejudice. The validity of the explanation is comparable across different cultural communities in a non-culturally biased evaluation. Provided that the test material, vocabulary, instructions, and validity requirements are culturally bound, it is unlikely that any test will completely eradicate the impact of learning and cultural experience. Nevertheless, eliminating culturally loaded objects, items that are found to be discriminatory to such classes of persons, increases the chance that it will be a culturally equal test. The chance of a culturally fair test is decreased by culturally loaded objects, such as those that use photographs or general data that are differentially prevalent within certain cultures. Of course, it can be difficult to ensure that the metrics that are being measured by the test in question do in fact hold no cultural proclivities, so it is for this reason that we do not claim to offer a culturally fair test. Certain elements which are measured by our test, such as spatial reasoning and logic, can be measured in such a way, however we currently are not yet able to offer a test that is considered as culturally fair, as the directions are in English. With that being stated, for a test to be considered as truly culturally fair, it must be devoid of any instruction as solving the test will be self-evident. Though intelligence is shared among many and countries and communities within those cultures around the world, what intelligence means for different people is entirely circumstantial. In a variety of real-world situations, intelligence is much more strongly linked to competency rather than mathematical or verbal quantifications of what we perceive intelligence to be in any given country and culture. This basic point is summarized by the famous quote, “if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live it’s whole life believing that it is stupid.” Much like the fish in this hypothetical example, we all have strengths and weaknesses. It would be silly to think that all those strengths and all those weaknesses can be quantified by means of a written test, therefore we do not claim to. What we offer is a fun way to challenge yourself and to test your limitations and your cognitive capabilities.`
