    'Many tests seek to measure what you already know. This is referred to as Crystallized IQ, or Crystallized Intelligence. Crystallized IQ can be expanded upon overtime, whereas Fluid IQ, or fluid intelligence/fluid reasoning classification attempts to measure what you have the capability to learn. Historical examples of various attempts to classify people by the categorization of their intellectual capacity were limited to observation of their accomplishments and behavior regarding their conduct in daily life. There was no standard, however, which led to confusion as to what intelligence meant from a psychological/scientific perspective. If you consider psychology to be a science, then there are obvious limitations in testing any variable in that way, same as there would be by having people only take written tests. Prior to the invention of the first IQ test, there was no viable way to measure intelligence (IQ), leading people to believe in many false presumptions about IQ and IQ tests; such as head size seen as showing a relation to intelligence, intelligence being routinely correlated with birth order, and left handed people being more intelligent than their right handed counterparts. All of these assumptions about intelligence are incorrect, some of which are still practiced in the world. We believe and maintain the idea that it is our duty to correct these errors. Not all of our research is related to IQ tests, however they make up a large part of our understanding where is is related to our available data. However, we also define/attempt to define the human condition by our understanding of what defines intelligence and also what causes certain proclivities towards negative behavior.',
    `IQ assessments have been performed for purposes of job recruitment, military service induction, and cases of identifying intellectual disability. IQ tests are performed to assess your intellectual ability, or your IQ; this is done by comparison of your test score relative to a wider population of data. If you score on the higher end on a test, it is an indication of your intellectual abilities relative to that area. Of the many abilities measured by IQ tests, including linguistic ability and numerical reasoning, general logic and pattern recognition, the extent to which your final IQ test score is reflective of your real world abilities tends to fall the more variables you try to measure. To solve this issue, we only measure three variables in coming to our overall IQ test score.

    `Many different IQ scores are calculated by comparing chronological age to mental age. What this means is if a five-year-old child hit the same stage as the typical eight-year-old child, he or she will have a mental age of eight years. Mental Age/Chronological Age x 100 was the original formula for finding intelligence quotient. A five-year-old who hit the same mark as his five-year-old peers will thereby score 100. The score of 100 has been held as the universal average score, and today it is still used. The average score on IQ tests increased across the world during the early years of testing. "The Flynn effect", named after Jim Flynn, who did much of the work to track and spread understanding of this phenomenon and its effects, is now called this rise. Many IQ tests are adjusted every few years for this reason. In order to keep the average score at 100; anyone who scored a 100 in the year 1950 would likely earn either a lower or higher score on one of today's IQ tests, depending on what test it is. We will update our tests every year for this reason. One of the first experimentally tested attempts of quantifying intelligence was in 1882, where English statistician Francis Galton developed the first establishment for mental competency evaluation in the world. The basis for this testing was that there existed a causal link between intelligence as well as a variety of observable traits such as head size, muscle grip and reflexes. After failing to show any correlation between the tested variables and scores of competency, Francis Galton eventually abandoned this method of research. It wasn't until 1905, that two French psychologists by the name of Alfred Binet and Victor Henri first published the Binet-Simon Test. The main measurement used for this test was linguistic and verbal ability. The overall goal of this test was to identify mental retardation in school children.`
