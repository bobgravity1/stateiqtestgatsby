    'Many tests seek to measure what you already know. This is referred to as Crystallized IQ, or Crystallized Intelligence. Crystallized IQ can be expanded upon overtime, whereas Fluid IQ, or fluid intelligence/fluid reasoning classification attempts to measure what you have the capability to learn. Prior to the invention of the first IQ test, there was no viable way to measure intelligence (IQ), leading people to believe in many false presumptions about IQ and IQ tests; such as head size seen as being related to intelligence, intelligence being routinely correlated with birth order, and left handed people being more intelligent than their right handed counterparts.

    `IQ assessments have been performed for purposes of job recruitment, military service induction, and cases of identifying intellectual disability. IQ tests are performed to assess your intellectual ability, or your IQ; this is done by comparison of your IQ test score relative to a wider population of IQ test score data. If you score an IQ test score within the higher end on an IQ test, it is an indication of your intellectual abilities relative to that area. Of the many abilities measured by IQ tests, including linguistic ability and numerical reasoning, general logic and pattern recognition, the extent to which your final IQ test score is reflective of your real world abilities tends to fall the more variables you try to measure. To solve this issue, we only measure three variables in coming to our overall IQ test score.
